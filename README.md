## Standard deviation comparison via the boostrap

### Current fleet

Standard deviation:
- upper = 6.950073968587861
- std-mean = 6.401805462179708
- lower = 5.808888915480925

Mean:
- mean = 20.14457831325301

### Proposed fleet

Standard deviation:
- upper = 6.897914239562367
- std-mean = 6.068930545150857
- lower = 5.139403406065087

Mean:
- mean = 30.481012658227847
